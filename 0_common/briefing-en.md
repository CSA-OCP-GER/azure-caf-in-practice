# Briefing on the customer

A global company wants to abandon some of its ageing data centers and replace them with a cloud platform.

- Sales and operations in several regions - global customer base
- Three business units
- Budget is a complex matrix about business and geography
- 20 private data centers around the globe
- Loose coupled global WAN
- All end-user email accounts are in Office 365
- The sales units in the company would like to operate a central CRM system in the future.
- The CIO and CFO want/must move two data centers and 5,000 VMs in 12 months
- There is no interest in investing in cloud governance, but a few cloud architects want to prepare for the inevitable.

The IT governance policy states that personal data (PII), financial data, and mission-critical workloads must be hosted by customers on assets directly owned by the company. The CIO is working to change this policy. Here, it would be helpful to ensure that the cloud provider can meet the previously strict requirements of IT governance globally if the PII requirement is relaxed.
